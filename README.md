# Rock Paper Scissors in Python! A text-based classic spin off!

## Pick your weapon and wage war with the computer - But be carefull! If you lose you will recieve a vurtual sting!

Prerequisites - You will only need [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to play.

Clone the project, `cd directory name`/download, and run the `game.py` file in a Python3 terminal window for mac/linux, or the powershell for windows.

The rules are the same as the classic:

1. Paper covers rock
2. Scissors cut paper
3. Rock smashes scissors

Choose your weapon wisely!

*The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.*

Built with Python3.

Enjoy!
